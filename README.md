# classRegistration

This project analyzes roughly how long it takes for classes to fill up during the regular registration window.

1. Search DukeHub by department and scrape HTML for class enrollment numbers in Python (registrationdb.py).
2. Iterate through list of class numbers by department for course names and topics if applicable (namesdb.py).
3. Write SQL to export registration data (writequery.py).
4. Join and export registration data to CSV with SQL.
5. Visualize in Tableau.
